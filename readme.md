<h1>How Great was The Great One?</h1>
<h3>A deep dive into the game-changing legacy of Wayne Gretzky</h3>
<h5>By Phil Rongo</h5>


<h2>Abstract:</h2>
Wayne Gretzky has been called “The Greatest Hockey Player who Ever Lived” by fans, coaches, fellow NHL players, and even the NHL itself. It should be reasonable to assert that because of his abounding dominance in the game of hockey, talent scouts and team managers would be wise to look for "Gretzky-like" qualities in their prospects. In this notebook, we venture to complete three objectives:

1. Display how visually just how dominant The Great One truly was - across almost all facets of the game. We will visualize offensive, defensive, and liability aspects of Gretzky's game and compare his achievements and statistics against his peers of the 1986-87 and also current NHL players of the 2022 season.

2. Using unsupervised learning, quantify how prevalent are "Gretzky-like" performance among the league's all-time superstars.

3. Explain how might scouts utilize this information to build better teams.

Raw data for this project was gathered from the **Hockey Reference** website (https://www.hockey-reference.com/), however some datasets - such as career_stats_greats.csv - were manually spliced together from multiple pages on their website.
